<h2>EssentialSubgraphLab: Essential Subgraphs of Random Graphs</h2>

<h3>About the Lab</h3> 

You are given a graph or digraph <b>G = (V,E,W)</b> with positive
weights on edges.  The <em>distance</em> between vertices <b>x</b>
and <b>y</b> is defined as cost of the least-cost path between 
<b>x</b> and <b>y</b>, summing weights of edges used in the path. 
<p>
For any pair <b>x,y</b>, the edge <b>(x,y)</b> may or may or may not be
the shortest path.  An edge of <b>G</b> is called <em>essential</em> 
if it is uniquely the shortest path between its endpoints: that is if
there is no alternative path of equal or smaller cost.  
</p><p>
The <em>Essential Subgraph Problem</em> is, given <b>G</b>, to find
the subgraph <b>S</b> containing only the essential edges of <b>G</b>.  This
problem has many similarities with All-Pairs Shortest-Paths.  
</p><p> 
The algorithm described here works by considering edges of <b>G</b>
in increasing order by weight, and building the Essential Subraph <b>S</b>
on the fly.  If <b>(x,y)</b> is essential (based on a search in <b>S</b>),
then it adds the edge to <b>S</b> and otherwise discards it.  The 
runtime is <em>O(ns log n)</em>, where <b>s</b> is the number of edges in 
<b>S</b> at the end of the computation.  In the standard averagae case 
model <em>s = O(n log n)</em>.

<h3>Projects</h3> 

<ol>
<li>Try more of the algorithm and code tuning ideas suggested in Chapter 4.  How fast can you make
it run?
</li><li>The tuning process would be very different if different input graph models were used.  Try engineering this
algorithm for road-map graphs. 
</li><li>Try tuning the heap data structure for a different application: for example to support Dijkstra's
Single-Source Shortest Path algorithm. 
</li><li>This algorithm is easily adapted to solve the all-pairs shortest paths problem. How would you adapt
these tune-ups to solve that problem on real-world instances?
